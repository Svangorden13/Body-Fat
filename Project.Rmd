```{r}
data <- read.table("bodyfat.txt")
names(data) <- c("density","pbf","age","weight","height","neck","chest","abdomen","hip","thigh","knee","ankle","bicep","forearm","wrist")
sapply(data, class)
apply(sapply(data, is.na), 2, sum)
par(mfrow = c(5,3), mar = c(2,1,1,1))

for (i in 1:length(names(data))) {
  hist(data[,i], main = paste("Histogram of", names(data)[i]))
}
sapply(data, hist, )
```

Make some histograms more granular?

Possibly make some variables categorical (height, age). Maybe convert height to cm?

There are several observations that seem to be outliers: an observation with 0.0 percent body fat, an observation with 29.5-inch height . These should probably be removed. Many of the variables seem to be roughly normally distributed, with some having slight right skew.
